# Getting started

The package is designed to ease the computations of biophysical processes in plants and other objects.

This package is part of the [Archimed platform](https://archimed-platform.github.io/), so it shares the same ontology (same concepts and terms).

## Processes

At the moment, this package is designed to simulate four different processes.

- photosynthesis
- stomatal conductance
- energy balance
- light interception (no models at the moment, but coming soon!)

These processes can be simulated using different models. Each process is defined by a generic function, and an abstract struct.
